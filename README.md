# basel_carbapenemases
Includes all code necessary to reproduce the analysis of our 2018 comparative genomic analysis of Carbapenemase producing bacteria isolated in Basel. Folders include:

* assembly/ -- Includes all python scripts used to assembly all genomes on the SciCORE cluster, as well as run all error QC statistics as described in the manuscript
* figs/ -- Includes all python scripts used to generate the figures of the paper. 
* synteny/ -- Includes all python scripts used to perform the synteny analyses described in the paper.
* coreGenome/ -- Includes all python scripts used to perform the quantification of homologous recombination within the core genome.

As of now, this repository is poorly documented. I hope to change this in the near future. In the mean time, if you would like to run any code here, please contact me and I will be happy to help.
